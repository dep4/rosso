## Issues

During this time I am trying to support myself, so I am requiring payment for
all issues. That might change at a later date. Any issue without payment of at
least 9 USD will be closed immediately. Payment can be made to the PayPal link
on this page, or if you need to use another method, mention that in the issue
text. For business opportunities, contact me:

- Email srpen6@gmail.com
